Don't you think that it's borin' how people talk?
Makin' smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because I'm doin' this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' the million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it
Gettin' pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (yeah)
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form, showin' people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
Pretty soon I'll be gettin' on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm known?
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (yeah)
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form, showin' people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
It looked alright in the pictures (yeah)
Gettin' caught's half of the trip, though, isn't it? (Yeah)
I fall apart with all my heart (yeah)
Yeah, you can watch from your window (yeah)
Yeah, you can watch from your window
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form, showin' people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like, yeah (yeah)
